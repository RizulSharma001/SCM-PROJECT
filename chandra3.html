                Around the equator is the best place to build an efficient space transportation system. Rockets can't be
                launched when they're far away from the equator. This means that the satellite weight has to be cut
                down. Currently, India has a rocket launch site in Sriharikota, called the Satish Dhawan Space Centre,
                Sriharikota.

                However, the PSLV could only place Mangalyaan in a highly elliptical Earth orbit. It would be the
                spacecraft's job to fire its engines at precise points in each orbit multiple times over the next few
                weeks to set itself on a trajectory to Mars, or it would miss the planet entirely. The trajectory design
                was highly unusual for a Mars mission but it worked. Once the spacecraft arrived at the Red Planet
                roughly 300 days later, it fired its engines again and successfully entered Mars orbit.

            <h1 style="margin-top: -400px;">What technologies did ISRO develop for CHANDRAYAAN-3</CHANDRAYAAN-3>?</h1>
        </center>
        <p id="p1">ISRO built upon its experience with Chandrayaan 1, India's first lunar orbiter, to develop
            Mangalyaan. The Mars spacecraft was a modified design of the Chandrayaan 1 spacecraft with upgraded
            components as required. For example, there were more and upgraded solar panels to make up for reduced solar
            energy available at Mars
            <br><br>
            ISRO also developed the ability for its ground stations to communicate with a spacecraft on another planet.
            With Mangalyaan, there were two-way communication lags of up to 42 minutes; this gap also demanded enabling
            the spacecraft to make autonomous decisions for situations where there would be no time for humans to be in
            the loop, something that wasn't necessary for Chandrayaan 1.
